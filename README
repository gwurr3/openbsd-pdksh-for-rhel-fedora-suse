This is a spec file I made for building an RPM of http://www.connochaetos.org/oksh/

This will get you a good version of pdksh on CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Suse, etc.

Many thanks to the guy who ported it: http://www.connochaetos.org/oksh/

Of course many thanks to everyone involved in developing ksh and the OpenBSD team!

There are some pre-built RPMs in this snippet, as well.
